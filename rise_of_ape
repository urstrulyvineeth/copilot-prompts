I want you to generate a complete, production-quality React + Canvas mini-game called “Rise of Ape”. 
The game must be fully buildable, visually polished, and playable inside a browser.

=========================
= GAME OVERVIEW
=========================
Rise of Ape is a fast-paced, floor-climbing survival game. 
An ape must climb from Floor 1 to Floor 10. 
Each floor has a different hazard. 
The ape can move LEFT, RIGHT, UP (climb ladder), or DOWN (drop back).
Colliding with any hazard = instant elimination.
Reaching Floor 10 = victory.

=========================
= CORE GAME RULES
=========================

PLAYER:
• Controlled with Arrow Keys (left, right, up, down).
• Moves tile-by-tile (grid based).
• If player touches a hazard → show red flash → GAME OVER.
• If player reaches ladder tile → climb to next floor.

FLOORS:
There are 10 floors stacked vertically.
Each floor has a unique hazard pattern:

1. Rolling Barrels – barrels roll across the floor.
2. Crumbling Tiles – tiles break after stepping twice.
3. Zapper Floor – sparks move across at intervals.
4. Sneaky Snake – snake lunges horizontally.
5. Conveyor Belt – floor pushes player left/right.
6. Flame Burst – periodic fire bursts from sides.
7. Shadow Floor – only area around player is illuminated.
8. Wind Floor – wind pushes player randomly.
9. Mirror Floor – controls reverse for 3 seconds.
10. Boss Floor – gorilla throws coconuts.

Only one ladder on each floor allows climbing up.

WIN CONDITION:
• Player reaches Floor 10 ladder → play short celebration animation → show WIN screen.

LOSE CONDITION:
• Hazard collision OR falling off floor OR time runs out (optional) → LOSE screen.

=========================
= GAME LOOP REQUIREMENTS
=========================

Use a Canvas-based render loop:
• requestAnimationFrame for 60 FPS.
• Delta time based movement.
• Canvas draws floors, hazards, ape character, effects.
React handles:
• UI (floor indicator, lives, restart button)
• Start screen
• End screens
• Score / progress

=========================
= TECH REQUIREMENTS
=========================
• Use React + Vite + JavaScript.
• Keep dependencies minimal — ONLY React & Vite.
• One Canvas element for rendering the gameplay.
• No external game engines.

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
• src/App.jsx
• src/GameCanvas.jsx
• src/engine/gameEngine.js
• src/engine/hazards.js
• src/engine/player.js
• src/engine/floors.js
• src/utils/helpers.js
• src/styles.css
• index.html
• vite.config.js
• package.json
• README.md

=========================
= IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
=========================

APE MOVEMENT:
• Tile/grid based.
• Smooth pixel movement, not jumpy.
• Use boundaries per floor.

HAZARDS:
Each hazard type should be implemented as a class or function object:
• update(dt)
• draw(ctx)
• checkCollision(player)
Hazards should be parameterized so floors feel different each run.

FLOOR MANAGER:
• Loads hazards for each floor.
• Provides ladder position.
• Handles floor transitions.

CANVAS RENDERING:
• Draw floors as horizontal lanes.
• Draw ape as a simple shape or sprite (minimal).
• Add subtle neon glow effects.
• Add hit flash (red overlay on collision).

UI:
• Floor number display.
• Restart button.
• Win screen.
• Lose screen.
• Title screen: “Rise of Ape”.

ACCESSIBILITY:
• Add ARIA labels.
• Show on-screen control hints for mobile.

=========================
= POLISH REQUIREMENTS
=========================
Add simple but effective visual polish:
• Screen shake on collision.
• Red flash overlay on death.
• Glow on ladders.
• Slight parallax on background.
• Animation on victory.

Animations must be lightweight and easy.

=========================
= DELIVERABLES
=========================
Generate the FULL project:
• Full working code for all files.
• README with:
  - Story summary
  - Controls
  - How-to-run steps
  - Features list
  - 4-hour build explanation
• Ensure the code runs immediately with:
  npm install
  npm run dev

IMPORTANT:
Write the entire game code clearly and fully.
Keep functions small, commented, and readable.

Start by generating the full file structure, then fill EACH file with code.
