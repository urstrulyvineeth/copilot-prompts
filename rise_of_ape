NO npm. NO libraries. NO frameworks. NO React. NO build steps. No imports. No modules. Just one folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

=========================
= GAME OVERVIEW
=========================
Rise of Ape is a 10-floor climbing survival game. 
The ape must climb from Floor 1 to Floor 10 using left, right, up, down movement. 
Each floor contains a unique hazard pattern. 
Touching a hazard = instant game over. 
Reaching Floor 10 = victory.
