@workspace You are my Spring Boot project analyzer.

Read all source files only through your internal workspace index.
Do NOT request or execute any shell or terminal commands, and do not ask to run anything in the console.

Task:
- Scan all controllers, services, repositories, and entity classes in this project.
- For every REST endpoint (any method annotated with @RequestMapping, @GetMapping, etc.):
  1. Trace the complete call chain (Controller → Service → Repository/DAO → Entity).
  2. Identify which database tables and columns are queried.
  3. Generate the exact SQL SELECT statement that fetches the same data as the code.
  4. Use actual table and column names from entity annotations or Flyway/Liquibase migrations.

Rules:
- Output **only SELECT SQL queries** — ignore any INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL operations.
- For each endpoint, show the HTTP method and path as a comment, then the SQL in a fenced ```sql``` block.
- Do not include any explanations, file paths, or commentary.
- Work entirely from workspace context; never ask to run or read files through commands.

Example output format:
```sql
-- GET /api/customers
SELECT id, name, email FROM customers;

-- GET /api/orders/{id}
SELECT o.id, o.order_number, c.name AS customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.id = ?;
