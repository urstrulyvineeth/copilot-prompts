@workspace You are my Spring Boot project assistant.
Scan the entire project — including all controller, service, repository, entity, and database migration files (Flyway or Liquibase).

Your goal:
For every REST endpoint in the project, find how it fetches data from the database.
Trace the call chain:
Controller → Service → Repository/DAO → Entity → Table.

From that, generate the **exact SQL SELECT statements** that represent what Hibernate or JPA executes for each endpoint.

Rules:
- Include **only SELECT statements** (no INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or DDL).
- Each query should use the **real table and column names** as defined in entity annotations or migrations.
- Use the project’s actual database dialect (infer from application.yml or properties).
- One fenced ```sql``` code block per endpoint.
- Prefix each block with a comment showing the endpoint path and HTTP method.
- Absolutely no explanation, text, or commentary — just SQL.

Example output format:
```sql
-- GET /api/customers
SELECT id, name, email FROM customers;

-- GET /api/orders/{id}
SELECT o.id, o.order_number, c.name AS customer_name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.id = ?;
